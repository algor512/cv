    My job duties included performing a wide range of analytical and data science tasks for several product
    teams (Mail.ru Search, browser and some other desktop applications):
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Forecasting financial and audience metrics (LTV, ROI, retention, revenue, market share,
        etc).
      \item Performing ad hoc analytical tasks (investigating reasons for KPI changes, carrying out
        requests for specific audience research).
      \item Planning and conducting A/B tests.
      \item Developing and maintaining a big data ETL system (which processed on a Hadoop cluster
        about 100Tb of data daily) to compute and forecast financial and audience metrics.
    \end{itemize}
